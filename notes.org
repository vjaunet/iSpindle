The idea of the projetct is to have Node-Red waiting for data from the esp8266

>>>>>>> requires node.js Dashboard

---- Install Node-RED on Synology NAS or on RPI -------
Install Node.js using the package center
Make sure user home service is enabled under user > advanced > user home (I didn't originally and node-red failed to start because it couldn't access the home dir!)
SSH into it and install node-red using command from official documentation (sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm node-red)
Type 'node-red' and it should be running at [nas-ip-address]:1880 !
